/**
Notes : 
    When shorthand `margin` property has two values, it sets `margin-top` and `margin-bottom`
    to the first value, and `margin-left` `margin-right` to the second value.

    There are two main model of color: the additive RGB(red green blue) and the subtractive CMYK(cyan, magenta, yellow, black)
    We will work with the RGB model; to use it we use the CSS `rgb` function that takes three values going from 0 - 255, red, green, blue respectively.

    Primary color are color that when combined at their highest creates pure white.
    Secondary color are color that we get when combining primary colors.
    Tertiary color are color obtains by combining primary color whit a nearby secondary color.

    rgb(0, 0, 0) -> black

    rgb(255, 255, 0) -> yellow
    rgb(0, 255 ,255) -> cyan
    rgb(255, 0, 255) -> magenta

    rgb(255, 127, 0) -> orange
    rgb(0, 255, 127) -> spring green
    rgb(127, 0, 255) -> violet
    rgb(127, 255, 0) -> chartreuse
    rgb(0, 127, 255) -> azure
    rgb(255, 0, 127) -> rose or bright pink

    A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near each other, and different ones are further apart. For example, pure red is between the hues rose and orange.

    Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors. If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray. But when they are placed side-by-side, these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter.

    It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page.

    Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue. For example, #4B5320.

    The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent colors.

    The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

    If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

    Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color. You must add the percent sign % to the saturation and lightness values.

    Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.

    A gradient is how one color transitions into an other.
    `linear-gradient` controls the direction of the transition on a line and what color is used for the transition.
    << 
        One thing to remember is that the linear-gradient function actually creates an image element, and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value.
    >>
    basic syntax:
        linear-gradient(transitionDirection, color1, color2, ...);
    transitionDirection in `deg`


    `opacity` describe how opaque or non-transparent something is.
    With the value 0, or 0%, the element will be completely transparent, and at 1.0, or 100%, the element will be completely opaque like it is by default.
    We can  also set opacity with alpha chanel using the `rgba` function.
    The rgba function works just like the rgb function, but takes one more number from 0 to 1.0 for the alpha channel

    For a border to be visible you need to set it width and style.
    `border-left-width`         -> for the width on the left
    `border-left-style`           -> for the style on the left
    `border-left-color`           -> for the color on the left side
    `border-left`                      ->  is a shorthand for the three border left properties.     border-left: width style color;
    `box-shadow`                    -> lets you apply one or more shadows around an element.    
                box-shadow: offsetX offsetY [blurRadius] [spreadRadius] color;
